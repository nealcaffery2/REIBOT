Real estate deal finding bot with zillow, chat gpt and csv
I have been creating this and trying to figure it all out
This has been a dream of mine ever since I was wholesaling to amherst, vinebrook homes, blackstone and other funds in america. I built deep connections with these guys and later found that they spend a lot fo money on softwares and beating ordinary people. I thought well lets start creating something to create a even playing field. Love a healthy comnpetition. 


This is meant to use zillow rapid api > chat gpt 4 > csv file in a chrome extension. I am trying to get it to look a lot better and actually freaking work. any help would be great.
